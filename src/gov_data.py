# representative government
# on inception a 4 year plan is made that is not deviated from
# this plan is an agreement on how to tax in the 4 coming years
# members of parliament MOP belong to 1 of 5 parties (set by wealth quintiles)
# depending on the wealth of each group, a target tax is calculated
# a voting process is replaced by a calculation factoring each groups target tax
# hence a final tax policy is arrived at

# data driven government
# taxes are adjusted monthly
# parliament is replaced by the entire population of households
# for each household a target tax is calculated instead of categorizing them into 5 parties
# all households have equal weight
